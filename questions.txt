Here are things I need to answer / sections in my data review paper

Independent Variables: code_type >= program name, len, block
Dependent Variables: rt, correct


- [] Effect of code_type / length on response time
  - Apparently no statistically-significant interaction

- [x] Effect of code_type / length on percent correct

- [] Learning effects
  - [] Effect of block on response time & correctness
    - Interaction effects with length and program type
