# code-comprehension
Code and research for my final project for COGS-Q 370, researching human comprehension of computer programs.


## TODO:
- Go through the code examples and make sure that each has an "interesting" answer - I currently see a lot of zeroes
- Figure out how to handle the quantity of things - I have 20 programs, with 4 lengths each, and 80 stimuli doesn't seem reasonable 
  - Maybe run it on a "typical" subject
